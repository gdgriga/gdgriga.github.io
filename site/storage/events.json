You can take a look at the problems and winning teams from past editions of Hash Code below. Work in a team of 2-4 students or IT professionals, get introduced to the problem by viewing live YouTube stream and start cracking! Are you up for the challenge?

As for Erlang enthusiasts, Elixir just might patch up your heart, likely broken by Erlang's archaic syntax and OTP APIs. We'll start with a couple of introductory slides. As for the main part, we will work on a massively-collaborative, distributed graphics application (no spoilers). You will have some time to be creative, of course, and best ideas will be rewarded with usual GDG swag.",

At this time, only Vim and Emacs editors provide Hack syntax highlighting and are integrated with the Hack typechecker -- one of the most interesting features of Hack. Don't worry: there will be a Vim crash course and support during the event. We won't leave Vim beginners one on one with the infamous editor. :-)",
